# Technical Documentation: JavaScript Solution for Calculating Table Requirements for an Event

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive solution for calculating the number of tables and additional chairs needed for a party or event. The function `calculateTables` aims to solve this problem by taking two arguments: the total number of guests and the number of seats available at each table.

## Problem Statement

The party planning committee needs to allocate tables for the guests. The number of guests may not divide evenly by the number of seats per table, leading to some tables having extra seats. The function `calculateTables` needs to determine:

- The total number of tables required.
- The number of remaining guests who will need to be accommodated at these tables.

---

## Function Specification

The function `calculateTables` will take two arguments:

1. `guests`: an integer representing the total number of guests.
2. `seats`: an integer representing the number of seats per table.

The function will return an object with two keys:

- `tables`: The number of full tables required.
- `remainingGuests`: The number of additional guests that need to be seated.

---

## Solution Approach

1. **Calculate Full Tables**: Use the JavaScript `Math.floor()` function to divide the total number of guests by the number of seats per table. This will give the number of full tables needed.
  
    ```javascript
    const tables = Math.floor(guests / seats);
    ```
  
2. **Calculate Remaining Guests**: Use the modulo operator `%` to find the remaining number of guests that will not fit into the full tables.
  
    ```javascript
    const remainingGuests = guests % seats;
    ```
  
3. **Return Object**: Finally, return an object containing both the number of tables and the number of remaining guests.

    ```javascript
    return {
        tables,
        remainingGuests
    };
    ```

---

## Code Implementation

Here's the full function code:

```javascript
function calculateTables(guests, seats) {
    const tables = Math.floor(guests / seats);
    const remainingGuests = guests % seats;

    return {
        tables,
        remainingGuests
    };
}
```

---

## Summary

The function `calculateTables` efficiently calculates the number of tables and remaining guests for an event, enabling better planning and resource allocation. By using `Math.floor()` and the modulo operator, the function handles both even and uneven division of guests across tables.

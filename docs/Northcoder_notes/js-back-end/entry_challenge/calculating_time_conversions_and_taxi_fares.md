# Technical Documentation: JavaScript Solutions for Calculating Taxi Fares and Time Conversions

## Overview

This document outlines two distinct JavaScript problems: 

1. Converting a time duration from seconds to minutes, rounded up to the nearest minute.
2. Calculating the fare for a taxi ride based on its duration in seconds, taking into account a flat base rate and additional charges for extra minutes.

## Time Conversion

### Problem Statement

Convert a given time duration in seconds to minutes, rounding up to the nearest minute.

### Solution

We leverage JavaScript's `Math.ceil()` function to round up the division result. 

```javascript
const minutes = Math.ceil(seconds / 60);
```

#### Key Points

- `Math.ceil()` rounds up to the nearest whole number.
- We divide the total seconds by 60 to convert it to minutes.

## Taxi Fare Calculation

### Problem Statement

Calculate the taxi fare based on the following rules:

- Journeys up to 3 minutes long have a flat base rate cost of £5.
- Every minute after the first 3 will cost an extra 70p.
- The length of the journey is always rounded up to a whole number of minutes.

The function `calculateTaxiFare` should take a number representing the length of a taxi journey in seconds and return a number representing the cost of that journey in pence.

### Solution

We used conditional statements along with arithmetic operations to solve this problem.

```javascript
function calculateTaxiFare(seconds) {
    const mins = Math.ceil(seconds / 60);
    
    if (mins <= 3) {
        return 500;
    } else {
        let over3Mins = mins - 3;
        const fare = over3Mins * 70;
        return fare + 500;
    }
}
```

#### Key Points

- First, we convert the journey time to minutes using `Math.ceil()`.
- If the journey is 3 minutes or less, a flat fare of 500 pence (or £5) is returned.
- For journeys longer than 3 minutes, we calculate the extra fare for each additional minute (70 pence) and add it to the base fare of 500 pence.

## Summary

Both problems were solved using basic JavaScript arithmetic and conditional statements. Special attention was given to the use of the `Math.ceil()` function for rounding up to the nearest whole minute, which is crucial for both problems. The taxi fare calculation also employed conditional logic to handle different fare rules effectively.

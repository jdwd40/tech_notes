# Designing a Project to Solve a Real-World Problem

Designing a project is not just about writing code. It's about solving a problem and designing a scalable and maintainable solution. Below are steps and considerations for designing a project that solves a real-world problem.

## Identify the Problem

The first step in any project is to clearly identify the problem you are trying to solve. This involves understanding the requirements and constraints of the problem space.

---

## Have a Plan

### Tech Stack

- **Front End**: Decide on the front-end technologies like React, Angular, or Vue.
- **Back End**: Decide on the back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, or Flask.

### Componentization

- How can the project be broken down into smaller, reusable components?

## Directory and Folder Structure

A typical directory structure for a full-stack web development project might look like this:

```
sample_project (root)
|-- github
|   |-- actions
|
|-- app
|   |-- backend
|   |-- frontend
|       |-- assets
|       |-- src
|           |-- components
|           |-- redux
|               |-- actions
|               |-- reducers
|           |-- screens
|               |-- auth
|               |-- main
|           |-- tests
|   |-- libs
|       |-- helpers
|       |-- types
|
|-- design-files
|-- README.md
```

## Documentation

- Document your code thoroughly to ensure that anyone can understand what your code is supposed to do, how to run it, and how to make modifications if necessary.

---

## Testing

While not mandatory for a hobby project, writing tests (unit tests and integration tests) demonstrates a level of professionalism and commitment to quality.

---

## Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Ensure your project is automatically tested and deployed using CI/CD tools. This could involve using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD, and deploying to environments like Docker, a URL website, or creating a one-click installer.

---

## Code Review

It's always a good practice to go back and review your own code. Try to do this about a week after you consider your project "finished." Look for ways to refactor and improve the code.

By following these guidelines, you're well on your way to designing a thoughtful, well-architected project that solves real-world problems.

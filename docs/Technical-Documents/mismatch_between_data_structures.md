```
studyPlan = 
```
### What Wasn't Working

The initial issue arose because of a mismatch between the data structure in your JSON and what the `.map()` method expects. The `.map()` function operates on an array, but `studyPlan` was not an array in the format you initially presumed.

Your `studyPlan` data was an array containing one object. That object had keys that corresponded to days of the week ("Monday," "Tuesday," etc.), and each key's value was another array with the day's activities. This made `studyPlan` a nested, complex structure.

### The Solution: Step-by-Step Explanation

#### Step 1: Initialize State
The initial state is set to an empty array. This is because we'll be flattening the data into a simple array of objects.

```jsx
const [data, setData] = useState([]);
```

#### Step 2: useEffect

Inside `useEffect`, I introduced a check to make sure the `studyPlan` array is not empty and its first element is an object. This safeguards the subsequent operations.

```jsx
if (studyPlan.length > 0 && typeof studyPlan[0] === 'object') {
  //...
}
```

#### Step 3: Extract Days Data
We extract the first object from the `studyPlan` array, which contains the keys representing each day.

```jsx
const daysData = studyPlan[0];
```

#### Step 4: Initialize flatData Array
We initialize an empty array called `flatData`. This array will store the final, flattened data.

```jsx
const flatData = [];
```

#### Step 5: Loop Through Days and Flatten
We loop through each day, get its activities, and flatten the structure. During this operation, we generate a new array that has the same shape as what your original `map` function expected.

```jsx
for (const [day, activities] of Object.entries(daysData)) {
  activities.forEach(activity => {
    flatData.push({
      Day: day,
      Time: activity.Time,
      Subject: activity.Subject
    });
  });
}
```

#### Step 6: Update State
Finally, we update the `data` state with the flattened array.

```jsx
setData(flatData);
```

#### Step 7: Rendering
The rendering logic remains almost the same, but now it operates on the flattened `data` array. This adheres to what `.map()` expects, which is why the data is displayed correctly.

```jsx
{data.map((item, index) => (
  <tr key={index}>
    <td>{item.Day}</td>
    <td>{item.Time}</td>
    <td>{item.Subject}</td>
  </tr>
))}
```

The key takeaway is to always be mindful of the data structures you're working with. Your rendering logic must be in sync with those structures for successful output.

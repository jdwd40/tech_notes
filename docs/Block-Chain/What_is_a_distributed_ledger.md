### What is a Distributed Ledger?

A Distributed Ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across a network spread across multiple nodes or computing devices. Each node in the decentralized network processes and verifies every item, thereby generating a record of each transaction that cannot be altered. Distributed ledgers can be public or private and may employ various consensus algorithms like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.

#### Key Features:

- **Decentralization**: Unlike centralized databases, control is distributed among multiple participants or nodes.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are public and transparent, although the level of visibility can depend on the design.
- **Security**: Transactions must be agreed upon before they are recorded, making the system robust against malicious activity.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Transaction Initiation**: A participant initiates a transaction.
2. **Broadcast**: The transaction is broadcast to all nodes in the network.
3. **Verification**: Nodes validate the transaction based on predetermined algorithms.
4. **Consensus**: Nodes agree on the validity of the transaction.
5. **Recording**: Once verified and agreed upon, the transaction is recorded on a new "block," which is then added to the "chain."
6. **Synchronization**: The new and updated ledger is then synchronized across all nodes.

### Comparison with Centralized Systems

| Feature                  | Centralized Systems                | Distributed Ledgers                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Control                  | Single entity                      | Multiple nodes/participants             |
| Data Storage             | Centralized database               | Distributed across multiple nodes       |
| Transaction Speed        | Generally faster                   | Slower due to consensus mechanisms      |
| Security                 | Single point of failure            | Decentralized, generally more secure    |
| Cost                     | Lower initial setup costs          | Higher due to multiple nodes            |
| Transparency             | Limited; defined by the controller  | High; all transactions are public       |
| Trust                    | Dependent on a single entity       | Built through consensus                 |
| Accessibility            | Limited, controlled access         | Anyone can join (in public ledgers)     |

Understanding Distributed Ledgers provides a foundational insight into modern transactional systems, enabling a new level of transparency, security, and decentralization not possible in traditional centralized systems.
